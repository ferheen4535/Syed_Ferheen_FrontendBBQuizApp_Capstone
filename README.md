## Product Recommendation Quiz Application for Badmaash Beards
# Capstone Project | Frontend (MERN Stack)


Welcome to the Badmaash Beards Product Recommendation Quiz App — a simple, interactive quiz that helps users find the perfect Badmaash Beards products tailored to their unique style and grooming needs.

Badmaash Beards is a local small business I've been proud to build from the ground up. From designing the logo and packaging to managing Amazon listings with SEO optimization, A+ content creation, social media marketing, and website design — I've been involved in every step of the brand's journey.

For my capstone project, I wanted to elevate this experience by developing a quiz app that guides customers to the right products with ease and fun. This project has been an exciting opportunity for me to combine my creative and technical skills, pushing myself further into full stack development.

The Badmaash Beards Product Recommendation Quiz App is an interactive quiz that helps users find the right beard products based on their preferences and beard care needs.

## Main Application Flow:

# Quiz:
- The user opens the app and navigates to the quiz.
- The user answers multiple-choice questions about their beard type, skin type, personality, and grooming needs.
- The app dynamically fetches quiz questions from the MongoDB database.
- After completing the quiz, the user's answers are evaluated to determine the best product match.
- The result is retrieved from the MongoDB database and displayed.

# Result Structure:

# Admin Panel:
- dmins can update usernames and delete users from the database.
- Access is protected by an Admin Login page.

## Future Plans

Share interactive quiz links across social media platforms (Instagram, Facebook, TikTok) to drive traffic and engage new customers.
Explore linking the quiz experience on Amazon storefronts to guide potential buyers in real-time.

# Enhanced Product & Routine Recommendations
Expand quiz logic to not only suggest products but also provide personalized beard care routines based on user responses.
Recommend product bundles (butters, oils, brushes, kits) for complete grooming solutions.
Include educational content for beard care tips, usage instructions, and maintenance routines.

# More Dynamic & Interactive UX
Add visual progress indicators and dynamic animations for a more engaging quiz experience.
Introduce user profiles to save quiz results and product preferences.
Enable sharing quiz results on social media with custom graphics.
